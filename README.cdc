// TodoList Smart Contract
This is a simple smart contract written in Move programming language that represents a basic todo list. The smart contract is designed to be used on the Move blockchain.

Overview
The TodoList smart contract provides functionality to manage a todo list where each user (represented by their blockchain address) can create and manage their individual todo items.

Structure
The smart contract consists of two main components: TodoList and TodoItem.

TodoList
todos: A public storage variable representing a mapping of addresses to TodoItem structures, where each address corresponds to the user's account.

init(): The constructor initializes an empty todo list when the smart contract is deployed.

TodoItem
account: The address of the user who created the todo item.

title: A string representing the title of the todo item.

description: A string describing the details of the todo item.

isCompleted: A boolean indicating whether the todo item is completed or not.

createdDate: A timestamp (UInt) representing the date and time when the todo item was created.

init(): The constructor initializes a new todo item with the provided values.

Public Functions
createTodo: A public function allowing users to create a new todo item. It takes parameters such as account, title, description, completion status, and creation date. The function creates a new TodoItem and associates it with the user's account.
Getting Started
To deploy and interact with this smart contract, you can use Move-compatible blockchain environments. Ensure you have the necessary tools and accounts set up to deploy and execute transactions on the Move blockchain.
